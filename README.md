# Recipe

This is a Modiel-View-ViewModel(MVVM) Recipe app that is build using a tutorial provided by CodingWithMitch(Playlist link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCYzUzKIBE_I0_tU5TvkfQpnmrP_9XV8)
While this is done by following a tutorial, some of the functions used by Mitch are deprecated and so I had to do my research to find the new functions, using the android developer documentation.
In the videos, to handle asynchronous image loading Mitch used Glide, but I found that using Coil is way easier to implement and is atleast as good as Glide.
